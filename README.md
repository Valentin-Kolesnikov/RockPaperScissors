Rock Paper Scissors (Console game)  
A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. Play against one or two computer opponents in a text-based interface.  

Features:
- Terminal-based gameplay.
- Play against one computer or two computers.
- Three rounds with repeated draws until someone wins.
- Randomized computer moves.
- Clear scoring system and round tracking.

How to Play:
1. At the start, choose whether you want to play.
2. Select the number of players: 1 (only you against the computer) or 2 (you against two computers)
3. Choose a move: a rock - number 1; a paper - number 2; scissors - number 3.
4. The game continues until victory in each round; a draw restarts the move.

I must finalize the project, make six-rounds mode and an announcement of the end of the game with the announcement of the winner.
