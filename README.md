# Rock Paper Scissors (Console game)  
A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. Play against one or two computer opponents in a text-based interface.  

## Features:
- Terminal-based gameplay.
- Play against one computer or two computers.
- Any number of rounds with repeated draws until someone wins.
- Randomized (used math.ceil; secrets.choice from the list which will be created by random.uniform) computer moves.
- Clear scoring system and round tracking.

## How to Play:
1. Open the .exe file or .py file if you have an interpretator.
2. At the start, choose whether you want to play.
3. Select the number of players: 1 (you against the computer) or 2 (you against two computers).
4. You can choose any number of rounds you want.
5. Choose a move: a rock - number 1; a paper - number 2; scissors - number 3.
6. The game continues until victory in each round; a draw restarts the move.
7. The announcement of the winner will keep track of who has what points, and then give the opportunity to win back (even to computers, if the player has definitely lost) if someone has a draw.
